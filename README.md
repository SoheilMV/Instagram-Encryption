# Instagram Web Encryption Algorithm
On the Instagram web page, when the username and password are sent to the server, the password is sent as follows:
>#PWD_INSTAGRAM_BROWSER:10:1685269331:AZ1QAOF9qeh0Wv8y9aAHPXSOPgkKapqopQ1oNhAT+10tZ84wAMhKnaumPJXG60Xo1/HZpAzh34xXBgW8NS/GSyF98/LnMCsuDRtfbcTMqU2KPt+aKvFxaIKK6lRHlVp7i54z0rZdTJs=

In this project you will learn how to encrypt your password so that the Instagram servers will accept it.
